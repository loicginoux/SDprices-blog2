This article explores how gamers can utilize memory cards to elevate their gaming sessions.

### **The Role of Memory Cards in Console Gaming**

- **Speed Matters**: Choose cards with high read/write speeds to reduce loading times.
- **Capacity**: A 64GB to 256GB card can typically accommodate a substantial game library.
